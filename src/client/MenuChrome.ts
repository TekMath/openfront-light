/**
 * The menu chrome that a starting game hides, and its inverse.
 *
 * These live together on purpose. Starting a game hid the ad rails, and for a
 * long time nothing put them back -- it did not need to, because every exit
 * from a STARTED game was a full `window.location.href = "/"` navigation and
 * the reload rebuilt the page. `openInvite()` (OPE-204) became the first exit
 * that leaves in place, and the missing inverse surfaced as a homepage with no
 * promos behind a frozen lobby list (OPE-255).
 *
 * The pairing here is deliberately NOT symmetrical, and it is worth being
 * honest about which halves live where:
 *
 *   - Ad slots: hidden by hideMenuChrome(), restored by restoreMenuChrome().
 *     Both halves are here.
 *   - <homepage-promos>: removed in openfront-light (no ads).
 *   - The public lobby socket: neither half is here. It belongs to
 *     <game-mode-selector>, which owns its own lifecycle -- see start()/stop().
 *     restoreMenuChrome() deliberately does not touch it.

/**
 * Has the chrome been torn down and not yet put back?
 *
 * This is the gate for the whole restore, and it is keyed on the teardown
 * ITSELF rather than on any separate signal that happens to correlate with it.
 * That distinction is load-bearing.
 *
 * The first version read the `in-game` body class, which looked equivalent and
 * was not: the teardown runs in `prestart.then(...)`, while setInGameSignal(true)
 * runs later in `join.then(...)`. For multiplayer those are two distinct server
 * messages with a real gap between them while terrain loads -- the
 * "prestart->start window" ClientGameRunner names. A leave inside that window
 * (Back, or a hash change, both reachable because `currentUrl` is also unset
 * until join) found the chrome torn down but the class never set, so nothing
 * restored. That is the bug OPE-255 exists to fix, arriving through a narrower
 * door.
 *
 * Keying on the teardown makes the gate true for exactly as long as there is
 * something to undo, whatever the join lifecycle is doing, and removes any
 * ordering constraint on the caller.

 * What each slot's inline `display` was before we hid it, so restore can put

 *
 * Recorded per element on FIRST hide only. hideMenuChrome() runs twice on a
 * real join (prestart.then and join.then in Main.ts), and re-recording on the
